# ComClicker
## How to play
ComClicker works just like Cookie Clicker; all you do is click the button and get points.  However in this game the points are contributed to a world score that all the players share.  If you create an account, you can save the amount of points you've contributed, and possibly make your way onto the leaderboard.
## Info for Developers
ComClicker uses NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, and Pug.  For MongoDB ComClicker uses the node package mongoose
